                <div class="prose max-w-none"><p class="mb-4">Every major city has thousands of Airbnb properties, and each one depends on reliable turnover cleaning. Most short-term rental hosts don’t clean themselves — they hire independent cleaning services. These services are growing fast but still run on spreadsheets, group texts, and last-minute chaos. Schedulers constantly update cleaners by phone, hosts get confused about what’s done and when, and payments are often tracked manually.</p><p class="mb-4">The money-making opportunity is simple: build scheduling and dispatch software specifically for Airbnb cleaning companies. It integrates with Airbnb calendars, assigns jobs to available cleaners, tracks check-in/out times, adds photo uploads for proof-of-work, and automatically generates invoices for the property owner. No generic CRM or big cleaning app is tailored to this niche — it’s either overbuilt or irrelevant.</p><p class="mb-4">You charge $99–$299 per month depending on number of units managed and users. Cleaners love it because they get clear job assignments. Cleaning company owners love it because they stop losing revenue to no-shows, missed cleanings, and messy bookkeeping. Hosts love it because their properties stay five-star ready. You make recurring revenue in a low-churn environment where software becomes operational glue.</p><p class="mb-4">This isn’t a "maybe." It’s a business that earns from day one if executed well. Cleaners are already making money. You just make the process faster, cleaner, and more profitable — and you get paid for it.</div>
