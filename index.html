    <h2>- My other Interests!</h2>
        <p>    
            In addition to my passion for translation, I am also interested in programming languages as well such as C, C++, Python, HTML and JavaScript. I enjoy taking on side projects and solving coding challenges, whether it's developing small web applications or automating tasks, I love exploring the world of programming alongside my translation work.
            I also enjoy the world of photography, whether it’s taking photos or just viewing them on the web.
