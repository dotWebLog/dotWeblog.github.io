                <div class="prose max-w-none"><p class="mb-4">You didn’t mean for it to become a business. Not really. You just needed to stop wasting time. There was a repetitive task — maybe something you did every week, or every time you spun up a new project, or every time a client handed you a spreadsheet and expected magic. So you wrote a bit of code. At first, just for yourself. Just to make your own life smoother.</p><p class="mb-4">It was basic. A few buttons. A config file. Maybe some duct tape in the back. But it did the job. And once it worked, you realized you’d never go back.</p><p class="mb-4">You shared it online, half expecting nothing. Maybe a few retweets, a single GitHub star. But over the next few days, the page got visits. People downloaded it. People emailed. A couple asked: “Can I pay to unlock more features?”</p><p class="mb-4">That was the moment something shifted. Not because of the money — not yet — but because someone else had the same exact problem you did. And your solution was good enough to buy.</p><p class="mb-4">So you added a checkout flow. Wrote some docs. Cleaned up the UI. Not a redesign — just enough to make it easier to trust. You didn’t spend weeks perfecting it. You just made it work better, for more people.</p><p class="mb-4">And the sales started. Small at first. A few dollars. Then fifty. Then a few hundred. Not loud, not fast. But steady. You stopped refreshing the dashboard. You didn’t need to. The emails just came. Stripe notifications. Support questions. Thank-you notes.</p><p class="mb-4">It became real in the quietest way possible.</p><p class="mb-4">You didn’t tweet daily. You didn’t run ads. You didn’t cold pitch. The software solved something specific — and people found it when they needed it most. While you worked. While you rested. While you slept.</p><p class="mb-4">That’s the difference. You didn’t build software that demanded your energy. You built something that gave some back. Something that stood on its own feet.</p><p class="mb-4">Now it earns, even when you’re offline.</p><p class="mb-4">It didn’t explode. It grew. Slowly. Sustainably. The way a tree does. Rooted in usefulness. Watered by trust.</p><p class="mb-4">And that kind of growth? That’s the kind you can live with.</div>
