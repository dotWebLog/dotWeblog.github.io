                <div class="prose max-w-none"><p class="mb-4">We’re addicted to interesting problems.
<p class="mb-4">The kind that impress our peers. The kind that spark Twitter threads. The kind that involve AI, LLMs, automation, or solving productivity for the ninth time.</p><p class="mb-4">But here’s the uncomfortable truth: interesting rarely pays.
<p class="mb-4">Boring does.</p><p class="mb-4">Boring software solves real problems for real people who don’t care about tech. They just want to save time, reduce mistakes, or get home earlier. Their problems are specific, repetitive, and unglamorous — and that’s exactly why they pay to solve them.</p><p class="mb-4">Every quiet success I’ve seen has something in common: the product is unsexy. A CSV cleaner. A notification filter. A niche CMS. A scheduling widget for funeral homes. Software that lives in the margins — ignored by big players, too niche for venture capital, but perfect for indie builders.</p><p class="mb-4">The mistake most solo devs make is building something clever, not something useful. They overthink the solution and underinvest in the problem. But boring software doesn’t chase hype — it chases use cases. The boring thing isn’t boring to the person who needs it. It’s a lifesaver.</p><p class="mb-4">Want to know what boring software feels like?
<p class="mb-4">It feels like:</p><p class="mb-4">One customer quietly upgrading to the yearly plan.</p><p class="mb-4">A Stripe notification at 2am while you’re asleep.</p><p class="mb-4">A user support email that says, “Thanks. This just made my week easier.”</p><p class="mb-4">There’s nothing loud about it. But it works.</p><p class="mb-4">And the best part? Boring software is stable.
<p class="mb-4">The tech doesn’t shift out from under you. You’re not competing with billion-dollar APIs. You’re not on the edge of burnout trying to ship features that move the needle. Because boring customers don’t want new features. They want consistency.</p><p class="mb-4">You get time back.
<p class="mb-4">You get leverage.
<p class="mb-4">You get paid — without needing to trend.</p><p class="mb-4">So if you're sitting on an idea that seems too dull to be worth building — good. That’s your signal. That’s your moat.</p><p class="mb-4">Don’t chase interesting. Chase income.
<p class="mb-4">Don’t build what impresses other devs. Build what helps someone do their job.</p><p class="mb-4">That’s The Quiet Code.</p><p class="mb-4">I’m @_dotWeblog.
<p class="mb-4">If you’ve built something boring and it earns quietly, I’d love to hear from you.</p><p class="mb-4">Until next time: Ship simple. Stay dull. Get paid.</div>
