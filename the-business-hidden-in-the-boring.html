                <div class="prose max-w-none"><p class="mb-4">You don’t always know you’re building a business when you start. Sometimes, it begins with boredom. Or frustration. Or that small flicker of annoyance every time you use a tool that almost does what you want but never quite gets there. Eventually, you give up waiting for someone else to fix it. You open a blank project, and you begin.</p><p class="mb-4">You don’t build it to sell. You build it to stop being annoyed. You strip it down to what you actually need — no extra features, no modern fluff, no pitch deck in the background. Just something that runs, and runs well. It solves a problem you’ve felt firsthand. It isn’t glamorous. It isn’t shareable. But it works.</p><p class="mb-4">And then, like clockwork, someone else runs into the same problem. They find your solution. Maybe they see it on a quiet GitHub repo. Maybe it’s a link buried on Hacker News. Maybe they stumble on a tiny post you wrote about how you made your life easier. And they try it.</p><p class="mb-4">They don’t need to be convinced. They just need relief. The moment your software gives them that, it becomes real. To them. And to you.</p><p class="mb-4">You start charging. Not because you’re greedy — because you need a reason to support it long-term. And people pay. Not all at once, not in floods. But steadily. The payments trickle in while you sleep. They arrive while you're cooking dinner, or helping your kid with homework, or on a walk. And for the first time, you feel what it’s like to decouple money from hours.</p><p class="mb-4">You’re not scaling yet. You’re not even sure if you want to. But you are earning. Not from a job, not from a gig, but from something you made — and something people want to keep using.</p><p class="mb-4">You improve it quietly. You add tiny touches. Better error messages. Cleaner exports. The kind of things no one markets but everyone notices. You’re not racing. You’re refining. And your users — real people, paying you real money — stick around because of it.</p><p class="mb-4">This is the kind of software business most people overlook. It doesn’t trend. It doesn’t raise funding. But it grows in the margins. It grows in the boring. And in those margins, you find freedom — slow, honest, and yours.</p><p class="mb-4">Eventually, you realize: you don’t need millions of users. You just need hundreds who care. You don’t need to change the world. You just need to improve a corner of it. And if your product keeps doing that, the money keeps coming. Quietly. Predictably. With gratitude.</p><p class="mb-4">And you keep building. Not out of urgency — but out of purpose.</div>
