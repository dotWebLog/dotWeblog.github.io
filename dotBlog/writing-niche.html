							<h3>> Writing Niche</h3>
							<p>Choosing a niche in writing can be an exciting step in your writing career and a strategic move that allows you to focus your expertise, attract targeted clients, stand out in a crowded market, and build a strong brand.</p>
							<p><strong>First, letâ€™s look at some reasons why selecting a niche is beneficial:</strong></p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Expertise and Authority:</strong>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Why it's great:</strong> Specialising in a particular niche allows you to become an expert in that field. Readers are more likely to trust and engage with content from someone who demonstrates deep knowledge in a specific area.</li>
								<li><strong>Example:</strong> If you choose the niche of sustainable living, you can become a go-to source for eco-friendly lifestyle tips.</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Targeted Audience:</strong>
