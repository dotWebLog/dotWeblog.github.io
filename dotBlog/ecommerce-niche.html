							<h3>> eCommerce niche</h3>
							<p>An eCommerce niche is a specific segment or category within a broader market. It focuses on the unique needs and preferences of a well-defined customer base.

								<li><strong>Example:</strong> The mobile app for fashion retailer ASOS contributes significantly to its success among younger demographics.</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Customer Reviews and Trust:</strong>
								<ul>
								<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> eCommerce benefits from customer reviews, building trust and influencing purchasing decisions.</li>
								<li><strong>Example:</strong> Yelp and Trustpilot provide platforms for customers to review and share their experiences, contributing to the success of e-commerce businesses.</li>

							<p>The eCommerce niche offers tremendous opportunities for businesses to thrive in the digital age. Its global reach, convenience, diverse product range, and cost efficiency make it an attractive space for entrepreneurs. Successful eCommerce businesses, such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Shopify, have demonstrated the potential for innovation and growth within this niche.
