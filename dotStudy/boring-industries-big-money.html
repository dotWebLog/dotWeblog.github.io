            <p>When people think of successful businesses, their minds often jump to technology startups, fashion brands, or luxury services. However, some of the most profitable and enduring businesses exist in so-called "boring" industries—sectors that may not be glamorous but provide essential services. Companies in janitorial services, pest control, and waste management have quietly built billion-dollar empires by excelling in efficiency, customer service, and scalability.</p>
            <p>Janitorial services may not seem exciting, but ABM Industries has turned it into a $6+ billion powerhouse. Founded in 1909 as a one-man window washing business in San Francisco, ABM expanded into full-service facility management, including janitorial, electrical, and energy solutions. By focusing on commercial clients and offering scalable, recurring contracts, ABM built long-term revenue streams. The key to its success has been acquiring smaller competitors, embracing sustainability, and leveraging technology to improve efficiency.</p>
            <p>Pest control is often seen as a necessary but mundane industry. However, Rollins Inc., the parent company of Orkin, has built a business worth over $20 billion by providing reliable and recognizable services. Founded in 1901, Orkin focused on national branding and customer trust. The company introduced standardized training programs and scientific pest control methods, setting it apart from local competitors. With recurring service contracts, a strong franchise model, and aggressive expansion, Rollins Inc. transformed pest control into a cash-flow powerhouse.</p>
            <p>Trash collection might not be glamorous, but it is indispensable. Waste Management Inc. is the largest waste collection company in North America, generating over $19 billion in annual revenue. The company expanded by acquiring smaller waste haulers and securing long-term municipal contracts. It also invested in recycling and renewable energy from waste, turning garbage into an additional revenue stream. By leveraging economies of scale, Waste Management optimized routes, reduced costs, and maximized profit margins, proving that even trash can be turned into a goldmine.</p>
            <p>The success stories of ABM Industries, Rollins Inc., and Waste Management Inc. prove that industries often overlooked as dull can be incredibly lucrative. Their strategies—reliable services, scalable contracts, national branding, and efficiency—demonstrate that fortune favors those who are willing to dominate essential but unglamorous sectors. Entrepreneurs looking for stable, high-revenue businesses should take a closer look at these "boring" industries, where big money is waiting to be made.</p>
